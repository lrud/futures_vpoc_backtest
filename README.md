# Financial Time Series Prediction with Robust Neural Network Training

## Abstract

This project implements a robust neural network training pipeline for financial time series prediction, specifically addressing the fundamental challenge of numerical instability in machine learning systems applied to fat-tailed financial data. The implementation incorporates four research-backed solutions to achieve stable training on large-scale financial datasets.

## Problem Statement

Financial time series data exhibits extreme kurtosis (kurtosis: 426) and fat-tailed distributions that cause gradient explosions and numerical instabilities in conventional neural network architectures. Standard mean squared error loss and traditional optimization approaches fail to converge on such data, preventing meaningful model training.

## Methodology

### Target Transformation
The primary innovation involves rank-based target transformation that converts raw returns to bounded percentiles:

```python
raw_returns = data['close'].pct_change().shift(-1)
ranks = stats.rankdata(raw_returns)
target_transformed = (ranks - 1) / (len(ranks) - 1)  # Scale to [0, 1]
```

This transformation eliminates extreme outliers while preserving ordinal relationships, reducing kurtosis from 426 to a bounded distribution.

### Robust Loss Function
Implementation of Huber loss (δ=0.1) provides robustness to remaining outliers:

- Quadratic penalty for small errors (|e| ≤ δ)
- Linear penalty for large errors (|e| > δ)

This prevents gradient explosion from extreme values while maintaining efficiency for normal samples.

### Architecture Stabilization
The network architecture incorporates:

1. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes hidden layer activations
2. **Residual Connections**: Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
3. **Learning Rate Warmup**: Gradual LR increase from 0 to 1e-4 over 1000 steps
4. **Dropout Regularization**: 0.1 dropout rate for generalization

### Feature Engineering
Statistical analysis of 1.14M samples identified the top 5 predictive features:

1. `close_change_pct` - Immediate price momentum
2. `vwap` - Volume weighted average price
3. `price_range` - Price volatility measure
4. `price_mom_3d` - 3-day price momentum
5. `price_mom_5d` - 5-day price momentum
